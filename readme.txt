This repo controls the file area of http://addons.nvda-project.org/files

if the addon is small and you dont have a place to host it, then add it 
to this git repo and push it.
You need to make sure to have a unique key in get.php for your addon.

then the file will be available from:
http://addons.nvda-project.org/files/get.php?key

We needed this because ikiwiki doesnt seem to like long links.
